Metaverse Advertising planning Guide

The metaverse opens up new opportunities for meaningful marketing, this step forward allows companies to explore brand new ways to reach their audiences. For this reason, I have reimagined advertising as an interactive experience, where the customer can really be part of the advertisement.

There are multiple ways this concept can be approached, I have outlined 3 possible experience types base on the demographic targeting: 

Passive Experience-
Target: Light VR Users, older audiences
Provides a storytelling experience, good for fatigued users in context that requires a lot of interaction or multiple ads.

Semi Passive Experience
Target : Users that are adapting to VR, 
Allows for a good blend of interaction and storytelling, engaging the user in a way that will not overwhelm them.

Playable Experience
Target: Young Generation / VR users
Allows for a great range of user interaction and engagement


Below is the storyboard example of what a Semi Passive experience for a drinks company

Introduction
User finds themselves inside virtual reality, they are in a desert landscape, the scene is color graded and sound designed to really sell the experience and feel heat.
There are heat distortion effects in the distance and blowing sand particles.

Acclimatization
The user can see a slight figure directly ahead, and the option to teleport forwards, we want the user to feel as they have seen a mirage and they are chasing it,

First Interaction
As the user moves forwards it is apparent that there is a podium they are approaching, with a bottle of drink on top.
Hero Moment
The user is prompted to grab the bottle and physically open it by hand, really selling the VR interaction.

Climax
Once the user opens the bottle a bright light appears from inside the bottle, creating the whole environment to shine, and the screen goes fully white, the user is transported to a vibrant lush oasis full of colour and vegetation.

Branding
The final part allows for the company ethos and branding to be shown concluding the experience.
